// Project idea: 

What is the purpose of the project? 

I want the project to enable people to have more control in thier lives so they can lead more fulfilling roles in life. 

What impedes people the most in thier endevour to self-control? 

Themlselves, none other. 

So how can you build an app that helps people get more conrol of thier lives? 

Have them learn more about themselves and strategize against their own mental hallucinations. 

How can this happen? 

The User must state a specific problem they are having trouble with in life || We can ensure that before any attempt at progress is amde that a clear mental landscape exists. 

User privacy is paramount and must be accounted for in program design. 

How can you make something people want to actually use? 

Should I design something like my 118 app but using the tools ive learned thus far and then have user analytics done on the data? 
  - Already have a layout 
  - Have a system to assign value 
  - Is about helping people 
  - You ahve a lot of experience in the self-help domain
  - It is something you can use yourself. 

  -- There are MANY habit apps on the market
  -- Been focusing on self-help for too long, need something refreshing

I want to make something synonymous with "The City"  idea I had in Australia; a city in which what you do each day populates the city with that given persona. So someone who wentto the gym, read and meditated would add a certain character to the city of +1 Mental Health, +1 Inteliigence etc.  The City has overall health based on the accumulaton of all the citizens. 

People with 'depression' simply need some strong people with better mental health. 

People who are fat need people with better fasting practic etc. 

Predictable attaacks on the city: 

  - Food choices temptation; daily 
  - Complacency; daily 
  - Addcition urges; daily 

When you are on a streak maybe that individual will be upgraded and then when you sleep that perso- the animated representation - arises in The city, your city. 

The city has defense based on the users ability to stick to certain habits.
